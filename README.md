# Phase1-Project-MCUapp
This is a web app that allows users to view information and create a personalized tracking list of all movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Web app was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on what was learned in Phase 1 of Flatiron School bootcamp. Data is fetched from an MCU public API at https://github.com/AugustoMarcelo/mcuapi.  No persistence included in this branch version.
